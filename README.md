## How to Use:

* Each page includes a string of text that can be copied into the GP2040-CE web configurator. The raw values are also included and can be entered manually. This is useful if your controller is on an older version of the GP2040-CE firmware or you want to use them with other devices.

* You can also download all the macros as text files from the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/OngoGablogian/Legends_Z-A_Macros/releases).

## Map Zoom Info:

* For macros that make use of fast traveling, you'll need to have the map zoomed all the way out (right analog stick down).

> [!WARNING]  
> These macros were made for the Switch 2 Edition of the game. If you are playing on an original Switch, wait times for loading screens will likely need to be adjusted.

> [!CAUTION]
> Be aware that the cut scenes for the day and night cycle will de-sync some of these macros, specifically the ones involving character movement.
